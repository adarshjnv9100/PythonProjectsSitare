Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a boy who loved stories.  
The boy would sit under a big tree every evening and listen to the old storyteller.  
The storyteller told stories about kings and queens, about brave warriors, and about magical lands.  

The boy loved these stories so much that he began to dream about them at night.  
In his dreams, the boy was a king, a warrior, and sometimes even a magician.  
The stories gave him courage, the stories gave him hope, and the stories gave him endless imagination.  

One day, the old storyteller grew tired and could no longer tell stories.  
The boy was sad, but he remembered all the stories he had heard.  
So, the boy decided to tell the stories to other children in the village.  

Soon, the children gathered around the boy, just like he once gathered around the old storyteller.  
The stories lived on, passed from one voice to another, from one heart to another.  
And so the boy became the new storyteller of the village.  

Stories have power.  
Stories connect people.  
Stories never die.
